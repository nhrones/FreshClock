# Fresh Clock

I built this as a POC for a `Fresh` animated canvas island component.

The code in the 'app' folder is heavily commented.    
I built this as a learning exercise for a grandson who was taking computer science at UGA.    
The interesting bits was reducing V8 garbage collection by building a resource-pool of dots.    
`See: /app/dotPool.ts`

Below the clock canvas are four slider controls.    
Try moving these sliders to change the animation.     
Have fun!
